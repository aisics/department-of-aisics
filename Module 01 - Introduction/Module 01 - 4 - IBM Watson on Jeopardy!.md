### The Exhibition Match

The historic match took place over three days in January 2011:

1. **Day 1 (Game 1)**:
   - Watson: $35,734
   - Ken Jennings: $4,800
   - Brad Rutter: $10,400
   - Watson demonstrated strong performance across categories

2. **Day 2 (Game 2)**:
   - Watson: $41,413
   - Ken Jennings: $11,200
   - Brad Rutter: $5,200
   - Watson showed particular strength in science and literature categories

3. **Day 3 (Final Game)**:

   - Brad Rutter: $21,600
   - Watson secured a decisive victory with a final score of $77,147 to $24,000

### Notable Moments

1. **Category Confusion**: Watson occasionally misinterpreted category names, leading to unexpected answer attempts.

2. **Confidence Display**: Watson showed its top three answers with confidence percentages, providing insight into its decision-making process.

3. **Human-like Errors**: Watson made mistakes that seemed surprisingly human-like, such as confusing Toronto for a U.S. city.

4. **Buzzer Timing**: Watson's ability to buzz in quickly after the light signaled was a significant advantage.

5. **Final Question**: In the last question of the match, Watson correctly identified "Toronto" as the answer to "Its largest airport is named for a World War II hero; its second largest for a World War II battle," but had low confidence (14%) in its answer.
