# AlphaGo vs Lee Sedol: A Breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction

In March 2016, Google's AlphaGo achieved what many experts had considered impossible: it defeated Lee Sedol, one of the world's greatest Go players, in a five-game match. This victory represented a watershed moment in artificial intelligence, demonstrating that deep learning and reinforcement learning systems could master complex strategic games that had long been considered beyond the reach of computers. The match captured global attention and sparked discussions about the future of AI and its potential applications beyond gaming.

## Background

### The Game of Go

Go is an ancient board game originating in China over 2,500 years ago. It is played on a 19Ã—19 grid with black and white stones, with the objective of surrounding territory and capturing opponent stones. Despite its simple rules, Go is considered one of the most complex games ever devised:

- The number of possible board positions is estimated at 10^170, far exceeding the number of atoms in the observable universe
- Unlike chess, which has clear tactical patterns, Go requires intuitive, holistic thinking
- Professional players often describe their moves as being based on "feel" rather than explicit calculation
- The game has resisted traditional AI approaches that rely on brute force computation

### Lee Sedol

Lee Sedol (born March 2, 1983) is one of the most accomplished Go players in history:
- Became a professional player at age 12
- Won 18 international titles
- Ranked among the world's top players for over a decade
- Known for his creative and unpredictable playing style
- Had a record of 9-2 against other top players in 2015

### DeepMind and AlphaGo

DeepMind, founded in 2010 and acquired by Google in 2014, developed AlphaGo as part of its mission to "solve intelligence." The project brought together experts in machine learning, neuroscience, and game theory:

- Led by Demis Hassabis, David Silver, and the AlphaGo team
- Combined deep neural networks with reinforcement learning
- Represented a departure from traditional game-playing AI approaches
- Built on earlier successes with Atari games and other challenges

## Technical Architecture

### Neural Networks

AlphaGo utilized two main neural networks:

1. **Policy Network**:
   - Evaluates board positions and suggests the most promising moves
   - Trained on millions of human expert games
   - Outputs a probability distribution over all possible moves
   - Helps guide the search process toward promising areas of the game tree

2. **Value Network**:
   - Estimates the probability of winning from any given position
   - Trained through self-play and reinforcement learning
   - Provides a global evaluation of board positions
   - Helps the system make strategic decisions

### Reinforcement Learning

AlphaGo employed reinforcement learning to improve its performance:
- Started with a policy network trained on human expert games
- Used this network to generate self-play games
- Trained a value network to predict the outcome of these games
- Combined policy and value networks to guide a Monte Carlo Tree Search
- Iteratively improved both networks through self-play

### Monte Carlo Tree Search

The system used an advanced version of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):
- Explores possible game sequences by sampling from the policy network
- Evaluates positions using the value network
- Balances exploration of new moves with exploitation of known good strategies
- Can look ahead hundreds of moves, far beyond human capabilities
- Adapts its search based on the confidence of its neural networks

### Training Process

AlphaGo's training involved multiple phases:
1. **Supervised Learning**: Training the policy network on 30 million moves from human expert games
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: Improving the policy network through self-play against previous versions
3. **Value Network Training**: Creating a value network to evaluate board positions
4. **Policy Iteration**: Repeatedly improving both networks through self-play
5. **Final Tuning**: Fine-tuning the system against professional players
