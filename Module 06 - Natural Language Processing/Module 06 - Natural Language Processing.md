# Module 06: Natural Language Processing

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. By combining linguistics, computer science, and machine learning, NLP systems can process text and speech data, extract meaning, and facilitate communication between humans and machines.

## Historical Context

The evolution of NLP reflects the broader development of AI:

1. **1950s**: Early machine translation efforts (Georgetown-IBM experiment)
2. **1960s**: Development of the first chatbots (ELIZA)
3. **1970s**: Rule-based systems for parsing and understanding
4. **1980s**: Statistical methods begin to replace rule-based approaches
5. **1990s**: Hidden Markov Models and probabilistic approaches gain prominence
6. **2000s**: Support Vector Machines and other machine learning techniques
7. **2010s**: Deep learning revolutionizes NLP with word embeddings and neural networks
8. **2018-2023**: Transformer models and large language models dominate the field

## Fundamentals of NLP

### Linguistic Concepts

1. **Morphology**
   - Study of word formation and structure
   - Morphemes: smallest units of meaning
   - Inflection: changing word form (e.g., tense, number)
   - Derivation: creating new words (e.g., "happy" → "unhappy")

2. **Syntax**
   - Study of sentence structure and grammar
   - Parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.)
   - Phrase structure and dependency relationships
   - Parsing: analyzing sentence structure

3. **Semantics**
   - Study of meaning in language
   - Word sense disambiguation
   - Semantic roles (agent, patient, instrument)
   - Lexical semantics (word meanings and relationships)

4. **Pragmatics**
   - Study of context-dependent meaning
   - Speech acts (requests, commands, questions)
   - Implicature and inference
   - Discourse analysis

### Text Preprocessing

1. **Tokenization**
   - Breaking text into tokens (words, subwords, characters)
   - Challenges: contractions, hyphenation, punctuation

2. **Normalization**
   - Converting text to a standard form
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing punctuation and special characters
   - Handling abbreviations and contractions

3. **Lemmatization and Stemming**
   - Lemmatization: reducing words to base form (e.g., "running" → "run")
   - Stemming: removing word endings (e.g., "running" → "run")
   - Differences and trade-offs between approaches
   - Popular algorithms: Porter Stemmer, WordNet Lemmatizer

4. **Stop Word Removal**
   - Eliminating common words with little semantic value
