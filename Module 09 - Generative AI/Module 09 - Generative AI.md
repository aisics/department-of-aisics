# Module 09: Generative AI

## Introduction

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of creating new content, including text, images, audio, video, and other forms of data. Unlike traditional AI systems that classify, predict, or analyze existing data, generative AI models learn the underlying patterns and structures of training data and can produce novel, original content that resembles but is not identical to the training examples. This technology has revolutionized creative applications, content production, and human-AI collaboration across diverse domains.
